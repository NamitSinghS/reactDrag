In order to run this project locally pull the **master** branch and run npm install, then run **npm run dev** to start the local server

Along with all the mandatory features I have also implemented one of the bonus features where 2 nodes if they are of same type they cannot be connected

Zustand has been used for state management, to keep things clean I decided to use state management tool

Tailwind css has been used to keep the code clutter free.

I implemented it using javascript even though I have been working with typescript for a while because I was not sure if all internal types have been exported by react-flow libraray or not

All the features have been implemented with core logic not external library has been used to accomplish something (used react table and react hook form since it was mentioned in the problem statement)

Table has also been virtualized for large worflows.
